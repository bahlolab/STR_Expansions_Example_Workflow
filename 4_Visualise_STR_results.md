# Targeted search for expansions of STRs known to be associated with disease

The `scripts` directory contains an R script [`4_visualise_str_results.R`](scripts/4_visualise_str_results.R).
This script loads the output generated by ExpansionHunter and exSTRa and generates plots to visualise the results at each locus.

```bash
Rscript 4_visualise_str_results.R
```

Note: this example workflow assumes that the `STR_Expansions_Example_Workflow` directory is in your home directory.
If it is located elsewhere, you will need to modify a single line near the top of the [`4_visualise_str_results.R`](scripts/4_visualise_str_results.R)

```R
results_dir <- "~/STR_Expansions_Example_Workflow/results"
```
